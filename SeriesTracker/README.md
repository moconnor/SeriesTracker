An attempt to build an application that can be used to record the books in a series and data about those books.
Far from finished but I believe it to be a good start.

Version History...

starting a bit late.

050425
1.0.5 - This was the version currently on my phone which worked but had several annoyances I wanted to address
        1.  Start Date for new books wasn't always working.
        2.  Authors were duplicated over and over
        3.  Book and Series status are out of synce
1.0.6 - This contains refactoring to address duplicate Authors both during creation of new series and books and importing from exported json.  This version marks the end of compatibility of importing 1.0.5 and older .json files.
        1.  This version also has the fix for the start date
        3.  Book and series status are still out of date.
